It was creepy. It was misty. It was dark. It was raining.
I stepped into the house only to get greeted with the creak under my foot. But of course, the splinters welcomed me too. I walked forward fighting the pain just walking.........walking into the uknown. I could not see what was in fornt of me not even 2m , it was too misty. I could feel bugs crawling at my feet and the cold air prickling at my skin. Yes it was painful, but i had no choice. I had to go in, no matter what. 
Just then, something caught my attension. Something was lurking in the dark. Something that was scard and scared. Something like me.
I stood there for a few moments. Whether hours past or minutes past, i dont know. I was just staring into the darkness, trying to find him. He walked in here, i saw, but where?
I continued. Into the darkness. Constantly looking back to check of someone would stab me from behind. It was quite possible now actually. You just didt know when 'THEY' would come. Where 'THEY' would be.
